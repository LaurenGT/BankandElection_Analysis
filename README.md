# Bank and Election Data Analysis

Above are folders housing bank data (PyBank) and election data (PyPoll).
Within each foler there is a resource folder, a python script file and an analysis folder.
The resource folder holds the csv file with the raw data. The python script can be run on this data file to return a brief analysis in the terminal. The analysis folder holds a text document with the same analysis that returns in your terminal scripted to print to a text file and save to this folder.
